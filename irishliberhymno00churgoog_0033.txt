remaining pieces in Τ and F, sor only a few—and those not the
most remarkable—have yet been mentioned.

The Irish hymns (Nos. 19-24) were probably sung on the
festivals os St Patrick and St. Brigid* They could hardly have
been in daily usev Perhaps, too, No* 9 belonged to the feast os
St Martin. Again, Nos. 4, 5, and (perhaps) 16, are suitable
rather sor use in time os pestilence or sudden danger, than as
part os the regular rule (see vol* ii, p. 172). ln some cases our
hymns were used privately. Nos* ι, 9, 14, ¹7. and 24 seem to
have been said as charms, the recitation of which was efficacious
against hurt and danger (see vol. ii, p. 210). The piece in
praise os hymuody (No. 41) prefixed to the F manuscript shows
how highly esteemed hymns were in this regard. Nos. ²5 and
26 also seem to be better adapted sor private penitence and
prayer than sor the public worship of the community.

The conclusion is thus suggested that the Liber Hymnorum
may have served a double purpose. 11 contains a number os
hymns and cantielen which are associated with the monastic
offices of Western Christendom. and it also contains pieces
which seem suitable sor private and occasional recitation¹ rather
thau sor daily use in choir.

But 1 am not sure that the collections in their present form
were originally made for the purposes os the Divine Office at
all. lt seems not impossible that the various picces may have
been gathered into one book at a time when the Celtic services
had given place to the English use, with the pious motive of
preeerving a record of an older state os things⁴ The copious
giossea which elucidate (or obscure) the meaning of the phrases
employed indicate rather the book os an antiquar-y than a ser-
vice book sor devotional use. Among the older Celtic monks
there must have been many in the eleventh and twelsth cen-
turies who retented the introduction os a new order os worship,
and who would sain preserve the memories os their past. Our
principal manuscript (T) might well have been written with this
laudable intention. The sact that the handwriting changes
