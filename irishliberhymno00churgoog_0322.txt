GLOSSARY Τ 0 THE MIRA, 285

dorne (?), 555 Α. atnoi ule oll·d, dte, where the gl. gives no explanation ol
all-d.; deine should mean ‘ rnen‘, but perhaps duan is at the bottom
ο1 the puzzle, and it means ‘poerrrs', and perhaps it is something
quite different from either!

ddt'm’b, [dat. pl. ο1 duim ‘homo ’], 467, 572. ι

‘dom·, infix prom 1 sig, 668 1011001515510111, gl. commea, cl. oooro‘domrig,
gl. dorat nge am, ‘gave kmgshrp to me ’.

domun, world ; 422 co d. dringthier, gl. ad coelum, or ro·bo do a slromain,
which latter has again an alternative, ι1011100 his good-gift ’, or ι1000
his good-gilts ’. But how dommi is to mean heaven, does not appear,

{rardodzmn infans the world, and not the sky, unless we elect to read
t. muru.

ending -llrier, found also 128 ngtlrier.

dron, firm ; 555 dchetal.

drur'b (?) staving (Cr.); 611 where the gl. has ‘there was breaking and
sorrow in the city ο1 Cond from the cio-druib that lell upon C. Cille,
when he went yonder [heavenward]’; but dmr‘b and do-dmr'b are
alike uncertain in meaning.

dub, black; 671 menna duba, gl, na mennata duba. ‘the black mansions'.
dui, lool, non-sage, opp. sui ; 226
dul, act ο1 going ; 611.

another incomprehensible ending (111ον) 01 pres. pass.

leil, see El.

ct'lsc, eitsct (?) 509 nad eitse bas bith, gl. ‘ that there be not fitted (?) lor him
death lor ever ', eitse, quasi istud (?), hut it can hardly be anything
else than nc audiit! [or perhaps ‘ne rnoriatur] ; 316 nad cilsctecnaide,
gl. ‘sages canino! tell 1t ’‚ m' lueto! a aisneis, or ‘one sage does not
listen 10 another', ni lec'r'tscnd [and Cr. adds two more suggestions,
one rendering cr'lset, ‘they die ², and another reading ecnarclt lor
ernaldo, with eren a third speculation, adding niad to cctraide !]

El, God ; nd 9 co harchangliu mil, gl. quia idem est Hel et ‘deus ’.

cll‹r[ . . . Ν) ellari, ‘conjunction’, 392, but the text in Cr. has ellaerchl„gl‚
ro‘ellged, ‘conjunctum est ’, ο1 the harmony ol' the moon's course
with the sun’s course.

‘ellar (?) 502 damur 1ό inbuilg, with a bewildering abundance ol impossible
glosses‚ ‘he gave them to salt ’, or ‘he rm‘lked them’ ie ‘he pacitied
them', [LU‚ ‘he used to 01510 them under the meanings ol their evil ³,
reading 0 n-uilc sor inbuilg ; or, ‘he used to vnit them that he might
inflict his proper penance on each'; or ‘it was the catching ο1 a
stock¹,· ‘he used to milk heliel upon them ¹ ; or, ‘he milked them lor
sallund’‚ (see inbuilg). Thus d0·ellar, is twisted into 0005301150-
taidled, gabail clla, no‘nnmuiged, norblt'ged (!)].
